# ENT Flu Slice - Medical Triage System

## Overview
"env_flu_slice" is an AI-powered medical triage platform for flu-like symptoms, leveraging WhatsApp for initial patient assessments. It aims to provide diagnoses and treatment plans for physician review, automate patient communication, and enhance healthcare efficiency and access. The system is designed for continuous improvement through a self-developing AI architecture, with a vision to transform medical triage into a more efficient, patient-centric process.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The system employs a constrained agent architecture with a plan/act/observe loop and a multi-system triage pipeline. It features a unified sheets registry for data configuration, a clinical state builder, and a modular, skill-based orchestration layer. An intelligence layer provides explainability and failure-driven rule suggestions, with an extended learning loop for continuous improvement. The Clinical Intelligence Planning Layer (CIPL) and Clinical Governance & Deployment Layer ensure continuous improvement and safe deployment of clinical changes. The system adheres to a 12-layer architecture encompassing Interface, Normalization, State, Knowledge, Safety, Reasoning, Decision, Learning, Analytics, Governance, Integration, and Orchestration.

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, `shadcn/ui`, and Tailwind CSS, offering intuitive interfaces for physicians, patients, and administrators. Key dashboards include the Clinical Simulation Lab, Clinical Control Tower, Executive Dashboard, Stress Test Dashboard, Patient Queue Dashboard, FDA Validation Dashboard, Decision Tree Explorer (ReactFlow visualization), Live Clinic Console (multi-tenant), and Production Readiness Console. The System Control Tower provides full system observability and control. The Clinical QA Dashboard offers a 3-column layout for quality assurance. The Clinical Improvement Lab features panels for Guideline Ingest, PubMed Auto-Ingestion, Gold Standard Gap Analysis, Evidence Scores, Evidence Ranking, Calibration, and Outcomes & FDA reporting. The Care Pathway Optimizer is an A/B pathway experimentation dashboard. The Skill Graph provides a visual representation of the knowledge base using React Flow. The Revenue War Room (`/revenue-war-room`) is a 5-tab financial intelligence dashboard covering Denial Prediction, Reimbursement Optimization, Physician Coaching (GPT-4o-mini), Contract Simulation, and Outcome-Weighted Revenue — backed by 4 new endpoints on the revenue pipeline routes. The Governance Command Center (`/governance-command-center`) is a 5-tab compliance and governance dashboard covering: Audit Trail (immutable event log with report generation), Policy Optimization (AI-driven policy tuning with auto-apply), FDA SaMD Package (Class II submission JSON generator with download), Quality & Payer (HEDIS metrics + 6-payer performance matrix), and Malpractice Risk (per-case scoring with driver analysis) — backed by 9 `/api/governance/` endpoints and 5 dedicated DB tables (policy_state, policy_updates, malpractice_risk_scores, hedis_snapshots, fda_submissions).

### Clinical Brain Engine v3.0 (Phase-Parallel Rewrite — Packet 16)

`server/core/clinicalBrainEngine.ts` fully rewritten (v2 sequential → v3 phase-parallel):
- **6-phase parallel execution** with `runPhase()` parallel executor; per-engine `ENGINE_TIMEOUT_MS` map (500–5000ms)
- **`withTimeout()`** wraps every engine, falls back to `SAFE_DEFAULTS` on failure, streams telemetry to Redis
- **Importance-weighted failure tracking**: `engineFailures[]`, `degraded`, `degradedSeverity` in every output
- **`schemaVersion: "3.0"`** — backward compatible; all v3 fields are additive
- **Safety gate**: hard short-circuit to ER_NOW before any reasoning when `safetyGuard.disposition === "ER_NOW"`

Core intelligence utilities (`server/clinical/`):
- `importanceUtils.ts`, `brainBehavior.ts`, `cognitiveLoad.ts`, `adaptivePlanner.ts`, `requeryLoop.ts`
- `chiefResidentReflection.ts` (7 consistency checks), `safetyEscalationGuard.ts` (hard override, final guardrail), `shadowEvaluator.ts`, `confidenceCalibrator.ts`

Redis-backed intelligence (`server/controlTower/`, `server/oversight/`, `server/memory/`, `server/meta/`):
- `engineTelemetry.ts`, `engineBandit.ts`, `metaLearningEngine.ts`, `oversightAgent.ts`, `cognitiveMemory.ts`, `memoryLearning.ts`

Multi-agent council system (`server/agents/`):
- `debateEngine.ts`, `consensusEngine.ts`, `multiAgentCouncil.ts`, `hierarchicalCouncil.ts`, `councilActivationBandit.ts`
- Specialist sub-councils: `cardiologyCouncil.ts` (HEART score), `infectiousDiseaseCouncil.ts` (qSOFA/SIRS), `icuCouncil.ts` (SOFA proxy)

API routes: `/api/brain-intel/*` (`clinicalBrainIntelRoutes.ts`), `/api/council/*` (`councilRoutes.ts`)
UI dashboard: `client/src/pages/ClinicalBrainDashboard.tsx` → `/clinical-brain-dashboard`
Tests: `tests/unit/clinicalBrainEngine.test.ts` (10), `tests/unit/councilSystem.test.ts` (28) — 590/590 total

### Technical Implementations
The backend uses Express 5, Node.js, and TypeScript, providing REST API endpoints. It incorporates Centor score calculation, red flag detection, a supervisor gate, and robust LLM integrations. Features include a Clinical Brain Engine, Self-Developing Medical AI, Telemedicine Reasoning Assistant, and an Agent System for patient flow. Clinical capabilities include advanced triage logic, medication safety layers, FHIR-lite structured output, and a Clinical Knowledge Graph. The system includes 30+ Complaint Packs with a Visual Rule Builder, an Adaptive Control Loop, and a Case Memory Engine. A Unified Clinical Pipeline orchestrates triage, self-improvement, and simulation. The Autonomous Operator System provides intent-based task planning. The Engine Control Center chains validation, scoring, billing, outcome, learning, and auditing. The Auto-Debug Engine monitors system health, and an Agent Coordinator manages registered agents. An SMS/WhatsApp Service handles Twilio-based messaging. A Stress Test System allows load generation, and an RPA Browser Agent provides UI automation. An FDA Submission Package generates validation reports. A Live Patient Queue manages real-time sessions. System Monitoring includes a Predictive Failure Engine. The Autonomous Loop runs learning and failure prediction, with a Safety Gate for non-bypassable safety. An Immutable Audit Logger logs every clinical flow. Explainability is integrated into the orchestrator, with critical Safety Engines for drug interaction, pregnancy, and pediatric safety. The Autonomous Brain includes a Self-Learning Engine, Golden Case Validator, and Clinical Safety Guard. A Global Intelligence Layer utilizes federated learning for privacy-safe data export and aggregation, including a War Room panel for monitoring. A Multi-Agent Task Bus + Evolution Engine manages tasks with 7 agents and an autonomous evolution cycle. A System Monitor provides live engine and skill health monitoring.

The system incorporates a Multi-Agent Debate Engine where three clinical agents (Hybrid Reasoning, Bayesian Differential, Safety Veto) argue over diagnoses, with consensus based on weighted accuracy. A Continuous Learning Pipeline, wired to an outcome tracker, applies temporal decay to policies and proposes RLHF weight updates for physician review. A Policy Evolution Engine manages outcome-driven policy weights. An Executive Command Dashboard provides a high-level view of pipeline statistics, agent health, predictive failure signals, and policy evolution. The system is 100% Knowledge Base (KB)-driven for diagnosis, with all clinical decisions managed via Postgres KB tables. Advanced Reasoning Engines include `coMorbidityEngine.ts`, `temporalEngine.ts`, and `outcomeLearningEngine.ts`. Plan Templates are fully migrated to be DB-first.

### System Design Choices
Data management uses Firebase Firestore, SQLite, and NDJSON-backed stores, with PHI retention policies. Authentication involves password-only, session-based HMAC for physicians and token-based access for patients, with JWT-based role authentication. Security and quality hardening include bcrypt, JWT security, rate limiting, and PHI Sanitizer. A Global SRE + Resilience Layer provides geo-aware routing, SLA monitoring, automatic debugging, and chaos engineering. Autonomous Governance includes an agent registry, audit agent, incident commander, digital twin, and predictive engine. The Autonomous Operator System is an AI-powered form automation engine. A Template Studio allows visual template editing. The Replay Inspector audits automation runs. A Robotics Control Module manages medical device orchestration. An Autonomous Learning Console provides a unified dashboard for self-testing, self-learning, and governance, including simulation, learning queue, drift monitor, audit trail, versions, and safety modes. The Multi-Patient Command Grid provides a three-pane, hospital-style dashboard with risk-sorted patient grids, clinical details, ICU waveforms, hospital/EMS routing, automated outreach, and physician auto-paging.

## Security, Safety & Compliance Architecture (12-Fix Hardening)

All 12 critical fixes from Claude's architecture review are implemented:

### T01 — RLHF Safety Governor (`server/governor/governorLoop.ts`)
- Delta cap ±2% per cycle prevents runaway weight drift
- Minimum 100 clinical outcomes required before any weight update
- Pending proposals stored to DB (`agent_weight_snapshots`) and loaded on startup
- Physician review queue: high-confidence proposals flagged for human approval

### T02 — PHI Guard for OpenAI (`server/middleware/phiGuardOpenAI.ts`)
- Regex scan strips 18 HIPAA identifiers from all messages before OpenAI API calls
- Every scrubbed call written to `phi_guard_audit_log` with field-level match details
- Wrapper `phiGuardedChat()` replaces direct OpenAI calls in clinical flows

### T03 — Twilio Webhook HMAC Validation (`server/middleware/twilioSignatureValidator.ts`)
- HMAC-SHA1 validation using `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` on all `/twilio/webhook` and `/telegram/webhook` endpoints
- Invalid signatures rejected with 403 before any message processing
- Raw body preserved in `req.rawBody` via express.json verify hook

### T04 — EHR Dead Letter Monitor (`server/services/ehrDeadLetterMonitor.ts`)
- Background service (60s interval) checks `ehr_dead_letters` table
- Any record unprocessed >15 minutes triggers clinical alert via `AlertDispatcher`
- Registered in server startup via `startDeadLetterMonitor(60_000)`

### T05 — Immutable Audit Hash-Chain (`server/services/auditHashChain.ts`)
- SHA-256 chained audit log in `audit_hash_chain` DB table
- Each entry includes `prev_hash` — tampering breaks chain
- Nightly verification job auto-runs on startup; verify endpoint: `GET /api/governance/verify-chain`
- Returns `{ ok, chainIntact, valid, totalEntries, errors }`

### T06 — Mandatory Physician Review Gate (`server/routes/improvementLabRoutes.ts`)
- All AI-extracted PubMed rules inserted with `status = 'pending'`
- No bypass path exists — rules cannot become active without physician approval
- GPT-4o-mini extraction pipeline always routes through review queue

### T07 — Study Design Weighting (`server/routes/analyticsRoutes.ts`)
- Evidence scoring formula restructured: RCT=0.95, cohort=0.60, case_report=0.20
- Weights: 35% evidence quality × study design + 25% effect size + 20% sample + 15% recency + 5% authority
- Prevents case reports from being scored equivalently to RCTs

### T08 — Legal Disclaimers (UI)
- **510(k) Disclaimer** (`GovernanceCommandCenterPage.tsx` FDA tab): Red banner — "This is NOT a Submittable 510(k) Document" with full legal text per 21 CFR Part 807
- **Denial Prediction Disclaimer** (`RevenueWarRoomPage.tsx` DenialPredictorTab): Yellow banner — "Statistical Estimates Only" with 18 U.S.C. § 1347 fraud warning

### T09 — BAA Compliance Matrix (`GovernanceCommandCenterPage.tsx`)
- New "BAA Compliance" tab with 6-vendor matrix (OpenAI, Twilio, Firebase, Google Sheets, AWS, Upstash Redis)
- Flags which vendors touch PHI and require BAA signatures per HIPAA §164.308(b)(1)
- Shows count of unsigned required BAAs with actionable next-steps checklist

### T10 — Role-Based Page Guards (`client/src/components/RoleGuard.tsx`)
- `RoleGuard` component wraps 6 sensitive routes in `App.tsx`
- `/governance-command-center`, `/system-war-room`, `/executive-command`, `/skill-layer-admin` → admin only
- `/revenue-war-room`, `/clinical-improvement-lab` → admin or physician
- Unauthenticated users see "Authentication Required"; wrong-role users see "Access Denied" (`data-testid: access-denied`)

### T11 — Production Feature Flags (`server/config/productionFlags.ts`)
- `PRODUCTION_FLAGS.CHAOS_ENGINEERING_ENABLED` — false in prod, controlled by `NODE_ENV`
- `PRODUCTION_FLAGS.SHADOW_MODE_ENABLED` — false in prod
- `PRODUCTION_FLAGS.RLHF_MIN_OUTCOMES_THRESHOLD` — 100 in prod, 10 in dev
- Chaos scheduler only started when flag is true (logged on startup)

### T12 — Global Safety Gate (`server/middleware/globalSafetyGate.ts`)
- Middleware registered on all routes immediately after body parsers
- Checks DB health before every request; returns 503 if DB is unavailable (fail-closed)
- Skips health check endpoints (`/api/healthz`) to avoid circular dependency

**Three-Tier Triage Router** (`server/physician/triageRouter.ts`)
- `assignTier()` — pure function: input debate outcome + disposition + confidence + flags → Tier 1/2/3 with rationale
- Tier 1 (notify-only, SLA 4h): CONSENSUS + HOME_CARE + conf ≥ 0.85 + no flags
- Tier 2 (eyes-on 30s, SLA 2h): CONSENSUS URGENT_CARE or any population/red flag
- Tier 3 (full review 15min): VETO_BLOCK, HIGHER_ACUITY_WINS, MERGED_DIFFERENTIAL, ER_NOW, conf < 0.40, prior override exists

**Command Strip Queue** (`server/physician/commandStripQueue.ts`)
- `getCommandStripQueue()` — loads all pending sessions, assigns tiers, sorts T3→T2→T1 oldest-first
- Checks `physician_overrides` table for prior override fingerprint matches
- Returns `tierCounts`, `batchEligibleCount`, and `batchEligible` flag per case

**Batch Part 11 Signature Service** (`server/physician/batchSignatureService.ts`)
- `batchApproveCases()` — batch-approves up to 100 Tier-1 cases under one SHA-256 Part 11 signature
- Canonical statement includes exact selection criteria — legally equivalent to radiologist batch read attestation
- Stores batch signature in `electronic_signatures`, links all cases via `batchSignatureId` + `batchId`
- Throws 401 on credential verification failure, 400 on empty batch, 400 on oversized batch (>100)

**Physician Inbox Broker** (`server/inbox/physicianInboxBroker.ts`)
- `ingestChannelEvent()` — normalizes events from whatsapp/telegram/web/chatgpt/voice/sms with deduplication
- `computePriority()` — classifies critical/high/normal/low from text patterns + event type
- `getPhysicianInbox()` — priority-sorted, filterable by channel and priority
- `routePhysicianReply()` — routes physician approve/escalate/override/flag back to originating channel adapter
- `registerChannelAdapter()` — pluggable adapter interface for each messaging channel

**Ambient Health Aggregator** (`server/monitoring/ambientHealthAggregator.ts`)
- `getAmbientHealthSnapshot()` — returns 6 health dots: KB, Debate Engine, Scoring Systems, Messaging Gateway, PHI Scanner, Outbox Lag
- Each dot: green/amber/red/gray with detail text and plain-English degradedMessage for amber/red
- All 6 checks run in parallel via `Promise.all()`

**Command Strip API Routes** (`server/routes/commandStripRoutes.ts`)
- `GET  /api/command-strip/queue` — tiered patient queue (filter by tier, paginated)
- `POST /api/command-strip/cases/:id/approve` — single approve + audit log
- `POST /api/command-strip/cases/:id/escalate` — single escalate + audit log

- `POST /api/command-strip/inbox/ingest` — channel adapter event injection endpoint
- `GET  /api/command-strip/health` — 6-dot ambient health snapshot

### Frontend Files

- `client/src/pages/PhysicianCommandStrip.tsx` — Full command strip page at `/physician-command-strip` (role-gated: admin/physician/clinician). Two-tab layout: Queue + Inbox. Keyboard shortcuts: J/K navigate, Space select, A approve, E escalate, O override. 15s auto-refresh on queue, 10s on inbox. Tier filter pills. Ambient health bar embedded at top. Batch select + sign workflow integrated.

- `client/src/components/physician/CommandCard.tsx` — Per-case card: disposition color, tier badge, channel badge, diagnoses, red/population flags, ER now message, SLA breach indicator, inline override form with 9-category dropdown. Four action buttons: Approve / Escalate / Override / (deferred via checkbox).

- `client/src/components/physician/AmbientHealthBar.tsx` — Row of 6 colored dots with tooltip on hover (label + detail + degradedMessage). Auto-refreshes every 30s. Amber/red dots pulse. Alert message if any dot is degraded.

- `client/src/components/physician/BatchApproveBar.tsx` — Sticky bottom bar. Shows count of selected and how many are batch-eligible. PIN/password input with Enter-to-submit. Calls `POST /api/command-strip/batch-approve`. On success: shows signature ID in toast, clears selection.

- `client/src/components/physician/TierBadge.tsx` — Color-coded tier pill (emerald/amber/red) with animated pulse dot for Tier 3.

### Route Registration
- `ROUTES.PHYSICIAN_COMMAND_STRIP = "/physician-command-strip"` added to `client/src/routes/routeRegistry.ts`
- Route added to `WorkbenchRouter` in `App.tsx` with `RoleGuard` (admin/physician/clinician)

## Self-Improvement Governance Layer (Hardening Packet)

### Overview
`server/agents/selfImprove.ts` was a minimal in-memory prototype (no DB, no governance). It has been completely rewritten with 7 hardening items:

1. **Distributed locking** — `runContinuousImprovement()` acquires a session-level Postgres advisory lock (`pg_advisory_lock(91424019)`) with explicit `pg_advisory_unlock` in `finally` to serialize cycles across all processes.
2. **Idempotent apply** — `applyImprovementAction()` checks `status === "applied"` and returns `{ applied: false, reason: "already applied" }` immediately.
3. **Compare-and-swap** — apply reads the current threshold from DB and verifies it matches `action.fromValue` before writing; mismatches fail with `"stale proposal"`.
4. **Explicit lifecycle** — `proposed | pending_review | approved | applied | rejected | failed` persisted in Postgres; never in-memory.
5. **Duplicate proposal suppression** — `hasOpenProposal(agent, parameter)` blocks creating a new proposal when one with `status IN ('proposed', 'pending_review', 'approved')` already exists for that agent+parameter pair.
6. **Validated stats inputs** — `validateAgentStat()` rejects non-finite runs, runs < 1, successRate outside 0–100.
7. **Physician review flow** — full CRUD: list pending, approve-and-apply, reject, per-action history, all routed through `requireRole(['physician', 'admin'])`.

### New DB Tables (created via psql)
- `agent_threshold_records` — replaces in-memory Map; stores `(agent, parameter)` → `current_value` with `UNIQUE` constraint for upsert.
- `improvement_actions` — row per proposal with full lifecycle status + metric JSONB.
- `improvement_reviews` — one row per physician decision (approve/reject) referencing `improvement_actions`.
- `improvement_cycle_log` — one row per orchestrator cycle: proposed/applied/rejected counts + durationMs + error.

### New / Rewritten Files
- `server/agents/selfImprove.ts` — complete rewrite; exports `evaluateAndImprove` (now async), `applyImprovementAction`, `approveAndApplyAction`, `rejectImprovementAction`, `hasOpenProposal`, `validateAgentStat`, `listPendingReviews`, `getReviewHistory` + backward-compat `computeBusinessMetrics`, `getImprovementLog`, `getAgentThresholds`, `startSelfImproveLoop`, `stopSelfImproveLoop`.
- `server/agents/selfImprovementOrchestrator.ts` — rewritten with advisory lock + 30s min-gap guard; writes `improvementCycleLog` on every run.
- `server/agents/selfImprovementReviewService.ts` — thin re-export facade for routes to import from.
- `server/routes/selfImprovementGovernance.ts` — 5 endpoints under `/api/self-improvement/`.

### API Routes (`/api/self-improvement/`)
- `GET  /reviews` — list pending/proposed/approved actions (physician+admin)
- `POST /reviews/:id/approve` — physician approves and immediately applies
- `POST /reviews/:id/reject` — physician rejects with optional note
- `GET  /reviews/:id/history` — full review audit trail for one action
- `GET  /log?limit=N` — recent improvement actions from DB

### Tests
- `tests/unit/selfImproveGovernance.test.ts` — 27 new tests covering all 7 hardening items (pure + DB-mocked). Total test suite: **353/353**.

### Backward Compatibility
- `payerIntelligenceRoutes.ts` routes calling `evaluateAndImprove()`, `getImprovementLog()`, `getAgentThresholds()` are updated to `await` the now-async functions.
- `metaOrchestrator.ts` calling `computeBusinessMetrics()` is unchanged (that function remains sync/pure).

## Batch 23 — Unified EHR Provider Model + Athena + SLO + Deployment (COMPLETE)

**Three major pillars delivered:**

### 1 — Unified EHR Adapter Interface (ECW / Athena / Epic)

**`server/integrations/ehr/types.ts`** — Canonical `EhrAdapter` interface:
- `EhrSystem` type: `"ecw" | "athena" | "epic"`
- `EhrPatientContext` — unified patient record shape (firstName, lastName, dob, sex, medications, allergies, problems, vitals)
- `EhrWritePayload` — unified write envelope (patientId, disposition, note, vitals, diagnosisCodes, cptCode, traceId)
- `EhrAdapter` interface — `getPatientContext`, `writeEncounter`, `writeObservation?`, `ping`
- `EhrWriteResults` / `EhrHealthStatus` types

**`server/integrations/athenaAdapter.ts`** — NEW Athena Health adapter:
- Authenticates via `ATHENA_API_BASE`, `ATHENA_PRACTICE_ID`, `ATHENA_TOKEN`
- `getPatientContext`: fetches patient + 3 parallel calls for allergies, medications, problems (each wrapped in try/catch so partial failures don't abort)
- `writeEncounter`: POST to `/chart/encounters` with departmentId, reasonforvisit, encounterdate, note
- `writeObservation`: POST to `/chart/observations` with vitals array
- `ping`: returns `false` rather than throwing when env vars missing

**`server/integrations/epicAdapter.ts`** — NEW standalone Epic FHIR adapter (replaces inline code in epicFullFlow.ts):
- Authenticates via `FHIR_BASE` + `EPIC_TOKEN`
- `getPatientContext`: FHIR `Patient/{id}` GET → name[0].given/family, birthDate, gender
- `writeEncounter`: FHIR `Encounter` POST with status "in-progress"
- `writeObservation`: FHIR `Observation` POST with valueString
- `postObservation` exported as standalone helper (backward-compatible)
- `ping`: returns `false` rather than throwing when env vars missing

**`server/integrations/ecwAdapter.ts`** — Updated: added `ecwAdapter` unified export at bottom:
- `system: "ecw"`
- `getPatientContext`, `writeEncounter` (throws on `success:false`), `writeObservation`, `ping` (returns false not throws)
- All legacy exports preserved: `sendToECWEncounter`, `safeEHR`, `syncSystems`, `ECWPayload`

**`server/integrations/ehrRouter.ts`** — NEW tri-EHR orchestration:
- `EHR_ADAPTERS`: `{ecw, athena, epic}` registry
- `PRIMARY_EHR = "ecw"`
- `getAdapter(system)`: returns the correct adapter
- `getPatientContextUnified(patientId, preferred?, token?)`: delegates to preferred adapter
- `writePrimaryEHR(payload, token?)`: ECW-only write
- `writeAllEHRs(payload, tokenMap?)`: `Promise.allSettled` across all 3 → `EhrWriteResults`
- `pingAllEHRs(tokenMap?)`: parallel ping all 3, catches errors → booleans
- `summarizeWriteResults(results)`: maps settled to `"ok"|"failed"` per system

**`server/integrations/ehrConsistency.ts`** — NEW cross-EHR data validator:
- `checkConsistencyMulti(epic?, ecw?, athena?)`: checks allergies (all 3 pairs), medications (ECW vs Epic, ECW vs Athena), DOB (Epic vs ECW) → `{issues, ok, checkedFields}`
- `checkConsistencyDual(a, b, labelA?, labelB?)`: any two contexts with custom labels
- Null-safe: missing contexts treated as empty arrays

**`server/integrations/ehrRouting.ts`** — NEW patient-to-EHR routing:
- `routeEHR(patient)`: maps `patient.system` → `EhrSystem | "all"` (case-insensitive)
- `routeEHRForWrite(patient)`: returns array of target systems — single if preferred EHR known, all 3 if not
- `isValidEhrSystem(s)`: type guard

**`server/integrations/universalWrite.ts`** — NEW 5-tier fallback chain:
```
ECW → Athena → Epic → UI Automation → Vision Agent → failed
```
- Each tier caught independently; falls through on error or `success: false`
- Returns `{success, tier, data?, error?}` — tier always indicates which level handled the write
- UI/Vision tiers use dynamic `import()` so missing automation modules don't crash the chain

**`server/integrations/ehrUnified.ts`** — Updated: now uses `writeAllEHRs` + `summarizeWriteResults`:
- `writeEHRAll(data)` → `{epic, ecw, athena}` — all three concurrently, graceful failure per system
- `writeEHRPrimary(data)` → `{ecw}` — ECW only with error swallow

### 2 — EHR API Routes

**`server/routes/ehrRoutes.ts`** — Added 6 new endpoints to existing FHIR route file:
- `GET /api/ehr/unified/health` — pings all 3 systems, returns `{ok, systems:{ecw,athena,epic}}`
- `GET /api/ehr/unified/patient/:patientId?system=` — fetch unified patient context from any EHR
- `POST /api/ehr/unified/write` — write to all 3 EHRs simultaneously
- `POST /api/ehr/universal-write` — 5-tier fallback write
- `POST /api/ehr/consistency` — cross-system consistency check
- `POST /api/ehr/route` — determine which EHR to use for a patient

### 3 — System State — Athena Integration Status

**`server/control/systemState.ts`** — Updated:
- `EhrIntegrationStatus` interface: epic/ecw/athena as `"ok"|"down"|"unconfigured"` + chatgpt/whatsapp as `"ok"|"down"`
- `integrations` field added to `SystemStateSnapshot` with safe defaults
- `refreshEhrStatus()` — async: calls `pingAllEHRs`, maps to status strings (unconfigured when env vars absent, down when ping fails, ok when ping succeeds), persists to `_state.integrations`

### 4 — Clinical Services

**`server/services/completenessGate.ts`** — Pre-triage context validator:
- `ensureCompleteness(ctx)` — checks required fields: age, meds, allergies → `{ok, missing, score}`
- `ensureCompletenessStrict(ctx)` — also requires chiefComplaint, sex
- Score 0–100 based on present fields; empty arrays treated as missing; null-safe

**`server/services/sloMonitor.ts`** — SLO monitoring + SLA tracking:
- `sloBurnRate(errors, total)` → `{rate, status:"ok"|"burning"|"critical", errorPct}` (>1% = burning, >5% = critical, divide-by-zero safe)
- `updateSLA(provider, latencyMs)` → EWMA update `0.7×old + 0.3×new`, load +0.05 (capped 1.0), non-mutating
- `resetSlaLoad(provider, decayFactor?)` → decays load by factor
- `approveAndSend(caseData)` → audit log + `universalWrite`, returns `{ok, traceId, tier}`

### 5 — One-Click Deployment

**`fly.toml`** — Fly.io production config: app `auralyn-brain`, region `iad`, port 3000, HTTP+TLS, health check at `/api/health`, 500-patient concurrency hard limit, persistent volume mount

**`scripts/up.sh`** — Docker bootstrap: copies `.env.example → .env`, validates docker/compose present, runs `docker compose up -d --build`, prints URLs for API (3000), Grafana (3001), Prometheus (9090)

**`docker-compose.yml`** — Full local stack: app + redis:7 + postgres:15 + prometheus + grafana with named volumes, `unless-stopped` restart policy

**`.env.example`** — Appended: `ATHENA_API_BASE`, `ATHENA_PRACTICE_ID`, `ATHENA_TOKEN`, `ATHENA_DEFAULT_DEPARTMENT_ID`, plus `FHIR_BASE`, `EPIC_TOKEN`, `ECW_API`, `ECW_TOKEN` sections
